              private-enquiry platform connecting clients with performing and creative artists. For the
              purposes of India&apos;s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (&quot;DPDP Act&quot;), we act as
              the Data Fiduciary for personal data processed through the platform, and you (as a
              registered artist or client) are the Data Principal.

          <Section id="information-we-collect" number="2." heading="Information we collect">
            <p>We collect only what&apos;s needed to operate the platform:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li><strong>Account information:</strong> email address and password, managed through our authentication provider.</li>
              <li><strong>Profile information:</strong> whatever an artist or client chooses to add — name, stage name, bio, category, skills, portfolio media, pricing, location, and (for artists) phone/email/website intended for private sharing.</li>
              <li><strong>Enquiry and message content:</strong> the text and attachments exchanged through the enquiry and private-conversation system.</li>
              <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> standard request logs (IP address, user agent, timestamps) generated by our hosting infrastructure for security and abuse prevention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect payment card details, government ID numbers, or biometric data.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section id="how-we-use-it" number="3." heading="How we use your information">
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>To create and operate your account, and to display published artist profiles publicly.</li>
              <li>To route enquiries and messages between the client and artist involved.</li>
              <li>To detect and respond to abuse, fraud, or violations of our Terms of Service.</li>
              <li>To maintain and secure the platform (error monitoring, rate limiting, audit logs).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use your data for third-party advertising, and we do not sell or rent personal data to anyone.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section id="contact-sharing" number="4." heading="Contact details and mutual consent">
            <p>
              An artist&apos;s phone number, email, and website are private by default. They are never included
              in a public profile page, public API response, sitemap, structured data, or search result —
              this is enforced in our database access rules, not just hidden by the interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              Contact details are revealed to a specific client only after the artist explicitly approves a
              contact-sharing request from that client within a conversation, and approval can be revoked
              afterward. Clients&apos; own contact details follow the same consent-gated mechanism.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section id="how-we-share" number="5." heading="How information is shared">
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li><strong>Other users:</strong> published profile fields are visible to any visitor. Enquiries, conversations, and messages are visible only to the two people involved, enforced at the database level.</li>
              <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> we use Supabase (authentication, database, and file storage) and Vercel (hosting) as infrastructure processors. They process data on our behalf under their own security commitments and do not use it for their own purposes.</li>
              <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> we may disclose information if required by law, court order, or to protect the rights, safety, or property of {SITE_NAME}, our users, or the public.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not share personal data with data brokers or advertising networks.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section id="retention" number="6." heading="Data retention">
            <p>
              We retain account and profile data for as long as your account is active. If you delete your
              account, profile and message data associated with it is removed or anonymized within a
              reasonable period, except where retention is required for legal, security, or dispute-resolution
              purposes (e.g., records of a filed report).
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section id="security" number="7." heading="Security">
            <p>
              Access to enquiries, conversations, and private contact details is restricted at the database
              level using row-level security policies scoped to the specific users involved — this means
              access control is enforced by the database itself, not only by application code. Passwords are
              never stored by us directly; authentication is handled by our identity provider.
            </p>
            <p>No system is perfectly secure, and we can&apos;t guarantee absolute security of information transmitted to the platform.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section id="your-rights" number="8." heading="Your rights and choices">

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Access, edit, or delete the information on your profile at any time.</li>
              <li>Unpublish your artist profile, making it private and non-indexable.</li>
              <li>Withdraw consent for a previously approved contact-sharing request.</li>
              <li>Block or report another user from within a conversation.</li>
              <li>Request a copy of your data, or full account deletion, by contacting us (see Section 13).</li>

          <Section id="cookies" number="9." heading="Cookies and similar technologies">
            <p>
              We use strictly necessary cookies/local storage to keep you signed in and to remember basic
              preferences. We do not currently use third-party advertising or cross-site tracking cookies.
              If we add analytics in the future, this policy will be updated before that data collection begins.

          </Section>

          <Section id="children" number="10." heading="Children's privacy">
            <p>
              {SITE_NAME} is not directed at children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from
              children. If you believe a child has created an account, contact us and we will remove it.

          <Section id="transfers" number="11." heading="International data processing">
            <p>
              Our infrastructure providers may process and store data outside India as part of their normal
              hosting operations. Where this occurs, it is governed by those providers&apos; own security and
              compliance commitments.
            </p>

          <Section id="changes" number="12." heading="Changes to this policy">
            <p>
              We may update this policy as the product changes. Material changes will be reflected here with
              an updated &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of this page.

          <Section id="grievance" number="13." heading="Grievance officer and contact">
            <p>
              For privacy questions, data access/deletion requests, or complaints, use the Report option
              inside a conversation for user-to-user issues, or reach out via the contact details on our{" "}
